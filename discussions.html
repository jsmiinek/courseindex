    <h2>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h2>
    <div class="container" id="container-1">Both articles articulate an ethical problem revolving around the freedom people have over their own practices due to centralization. Reading 1 mentions how companies like Adobe and Apple hold power over designers as they are known to be industry-standard tools within the design world, and how that power does not allow for designers to have complete control over their own practice leaving most design work to appear similar to each other as it is all created using the same tools.  This can connect to reading 2, where it mentions GitHub, an open-source repository being acquired by Microsoft, which threatens autonomy and the nonproprietary coding languages that were popularized by GitHub. The same control Adobe has on designers is similar to the control Microsoft now has on coders after the acquisition. Aside from mastery of certain digital tools and programs, I see the ability to come up with different ideas important in my graphic design practice, as this gives each designer our own identity and prevents work from looking all the same, making it more interesting. </div>
