    <h2>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h2>
    <div class="container" id="container-1">Both articles articulate an ethical problem revolving around the freedom people have over their own practices due to centralization. Reading 1 mentions how companies like Adobe and Apple hold power over designers as they are known to be industry-standard tools within the design world, and how that power does not allow for designers to have complete control over their own practice leaving most design work to appear similar to each other as it is all created using the same tools.  This can connect to reading 2, where it mentions GitHub, an open-source repository being acquired by Microsoft, which threatens autonomy and the nonproprietary coding languages that were popularized by GitHub. The same control Adobe has on designers is similar to the control Microsoft now has on coders after the acquisition. Aside from mastery of certain digital tools and programs, I see the ability to come up with different ideas important in my graphic design practice, as this gives each designer our own identity and prevents work from looking all the same, making it more interesting. </div>
    <h3>Reading Discussion II: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</h3>
    <div class="container" id="container-2">Lialina's definition of a universal user is a useful category in understanding Schwulst advocating for individual websites over platforms. As mentioned by Lialina, universal users have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the application or device used, and will find a way to their aspiration. This ambition that a universal user has leads them to think outside of the box and become more 'visible', which in other words more individualized. This can relate to Schwulst's idea that a website should be an individual act of collective ambition instead of being run by big corporations that prioritize advertising over users' needs and confine users into a box. I believe I'm somewhat a universal user as I spend a lot of time on the computer and web in general, leading me to explore and find alternative ways to do things rather than using a specific program or software. I also found myself relating to some of the examples about universal users mentioned by Lialina, specifically in the text “You can have two Twitter accounts and log in to one in Firefox, and the other in Chrome. This is how I do it and it doesn't matter why I prefer to manage it this way. Maybe I don't know that an app for managing multiple accounts exists, maybe I knew but didn't like it, or maybe I'm too lazy to install it. Whatever, I found a way. And you will do as well.” I found this part relatable as I have often found other ways to do things on the computer because I was too lazy to install a program or I just didn't like the programs available. Overall, this reading informed me about universal users and how I can possibly be defined as one, and makes me pay more attention to how I actually use computers and the world wide web. It makes me realize that my experience and the way I use computers form an online experience of a room, since it lets me have a space of my own where I can do what I want and create endless doorways to other rooms.</div>
